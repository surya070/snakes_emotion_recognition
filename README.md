# Emotion-Based Dynamic Difficulty Dodge the Boxes Game
A dynamic game that adapts to the player's emotions in real-time using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion recognition. 

The game successfully adjusts its difficulty based on the detected emotions. For example, when the player is happy, the game's speed increases, making it more challenging. When the player is sad or neutral, the game's speed decreases, making it easier.
